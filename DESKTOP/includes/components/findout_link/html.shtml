					    Since then, the Cartier Collection has never stopped growing and travelling. Since 1989, it has mounted more than 25
					    major exhibitions in the most prestigious museums on five continents.
					    Today it contains almost 1500 exceptional pieces acquired in public sales
					    or from individuals. Three major publications have been devoted to it – with each piece described in detail and shown in
					   actual size – by éditions Flammarion: <i>La Collection Cartier</i> – <i>Joaillerie</i> (2004),
					    <i>La Collection Cartier</i> – <i>Horlogerie</i> (2006), <i>La Collection Cartier</i> – <i>Accessoires</i> (2012).    </p>

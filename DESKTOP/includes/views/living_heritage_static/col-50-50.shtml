            Louis Cartier was the first jeweler who set the design codes of modern watchmaking. Unlike his contemporaries, he believed the beauty of a watch was not just a matter of its decoration. Its size, shape and proportions, the look of the metal, the harmony between bracelet and case counted for just as much. He soon became interested in "Shaped watches" – those with a case that broke away from the traditional round design. "Tonneau" shaped watches in 1906, square cases from 1908, and "tortue" shapes in 1912 were the first examples of very beautiful watchmaking created by an innovative jeweler. Cartier never stopped conceiving new shapes,  sometimes eccentric, often very daring, but always refined.

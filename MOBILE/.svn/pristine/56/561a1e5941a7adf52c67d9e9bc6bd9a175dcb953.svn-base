       <p>
       		From April 16 to October 27, 2013, the Fondation Cartier pour lâ€™art contemporain will be presenting work by the Australian sculptor Ron Mueck, in a show that marks his return to institutional exhibiting in Europe.
       	</p>
       	<p>
       		This new, highly personal show is the most complete, up-to-date presentation of his work since his success at the Fondation Cartier in 2005. In addition to six recent sculptures, three pieces specially produced for this exhibiition will be on display.
			Based in London, Ron Mueck has exhibited in museums around the world including in Japan, Australia, Mexico and New Zealand. This event is particularly important because it is one of the very rare opportunities to see his sculptures in public. He works slowly in his London studio, making time an important element in his creativity.
